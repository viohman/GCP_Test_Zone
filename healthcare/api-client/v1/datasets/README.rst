This directory contains samples for Cloud Healthcare API. `Cloud Healthcare API`_ implements healthcare-native protocols and formats to accelerate ingestion, storage, analysis, and integration of healthcare data with cloud-based applications.
- See the `migration guide`_ for information about migrating to Python client library v0.25.1.

.. _migration guide: https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/python-client-migration




.. _Cloud Healthcare API: https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs

To run the sample, you need to enable the API at: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/healthcare.googleapis.com

To run the sample, you need to have `Healthcare Dataset Administrator` role.
