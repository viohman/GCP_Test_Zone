## Holiday.csv Data

The data found in [`holidays.csv`](./holidays.csv) is derived from data found on the [US Open Government Federal Holiday Webpage](https://www.opm.gov/about-us/open-government/Data/Apps/Holidays/Index.aspx). It was converted from iCalendar format to CSV following instructions found in [this blog post](https://medium.com/@leah.e.cole/how-to-use-python-to-turn-icalendar-data-into-a-csv-of-dates-93d95926231d).
